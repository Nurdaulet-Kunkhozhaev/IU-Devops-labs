## Best practices
- Followed PEP 8 guidelines
- Used virtual environment
- Documented the code

## Why Flask is a choice
Flask is a production-ready framework. Due to it simplicity for beginners like me I managed to do this lab in no time.

##Advantages of Flask
It is:
- Scalable
- Flexible
- Easy to negotiate
- Lightweight

##Disadvantages of Flask
In flask:
- Not a lot of tools
- Difficult to get familiar with larger apps
- Maintenance costs

## Linters
I used Pylint and Markdownlint

## Unit tests
This app contains 1 test:
- `test_moscow_time()` is a unit test for verifying that returned time is of Moscow

Best practices:
- Test directory structure has the same structure as of project
- Keeping tests simple - they should test as isolated functionality as possible
- Integrating testing into CI
